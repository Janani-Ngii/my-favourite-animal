    <p>This essay is about my cat. Her name is Snow. <br> She is <em>white with brown and black spots</em> and is very<strong> playful.</strong>  <br> When around her she loves to lie on my laps. <br> She also loves to play with yarns and running around the house.</p>
<p> Here are a few pictures of my dear Snow. <br> <img src="Images/mycat.jpeg" alt="Snow's image"> <br> <img src="Images/mycat2.jpeg" alt="Another image of Snow"> <br> <img src="Images/mycat3.jpeg"> </p>
